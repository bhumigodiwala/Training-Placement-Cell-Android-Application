# Training-Placement-Cell-Android-Application

Placement and Training (PAT) cell is the bridge between the students and businesses that visit the recruitment campus so that all PAT cell information and activities are relevant. By automating critical PAT cell tasks such as displaying notifications, holding student information, student qualifications, business requirements, training sessions, schedule of interviews, planning seminars, etc. The program aims to reduce human resources and errors. To achieve that automation, we developed an Android framework. 

The proposed system is an Android application to monitor mobile student information and keep them up to date on the latest activities at the college. The program will be used by the students, teachers and parents. Let n number of students, n number of streams, n number of recruiters be running the placement process smoothly. As an Android application it's portable and acceptable to most users.
